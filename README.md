# trajectory-likelihood

This is an expository implementation of the method to calculate alignment gap probabilities by trajectory enumeration, as described by Mikl√≥s, Lunter &amp; Holmes in the paper
[A "Long Indel" model for evolutionary sequence alignment](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14694074) (2004).

The code includes an implementation of Algorithm 1 from the MLH 2004 paper, which computes the likelihood of a state trajectory in an arbitrary continuous-time discrete-state Markov chain,
with event times integrated out.

For clarity, this code currently makes the following simplifications relative to the full "Long Indel" model described in the paper:
- Currently it only calculates the gap likelihoods for internal chop zones (i.e. not the regions at the ends of the sequence, nor the probability of deleting/inserting the entire sequence). This is equivalent to considering only infinitely long sequences.
- Currently it does not use a mixture of geometric distributions for the indel lengths, just a single geometric distribution.

Generalizing the code to cover these cases would be relatively straightforward, and only involve changing the calculation of zone exit probabilities and transition rates.
The "work" of the implementation is largely in counting trajectories and calculating their probabilities.

## Installation

The [Boost](https://www.boost.org/) library is required for the command-line tool (though not if you just want to link to the C++ code).

Type `make` to compile the command-line tool.

## Running

~~~~
./trajeclike --gamma .99 --mu .049 -r .543 --maxlen 20 --maxevents 3 --time 1 -v1

The values of the mu and r parameters here are (from the MLH 2004 paper) the maximum likelihood fit of a single-component geometric indel distribution to protein alignments in the [HOMSTRAD](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9828015) database.
